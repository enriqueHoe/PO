Portfolio Optimization

This collaborative Project implements a risk-adjusted Portfolio optimization strategy in Excel. The analysis includes covariance Matrix estimation, correlation analysis, efficient frontier construction, Sharpe Ratio maximization & Capital/Security Line derivations.

Data:
- Monthly data from 1990-2022
- Assets: Crude Oil WTI, MSCI Mexico, S&P 500 Composite, OMX STOCKHOLM 30 , Palladium, BD EU-MARK 3M DEPOSIT

Methodology:
-Statistical Analysis:
	- Developed Monthly & annual covariance Matrices
	- Correlation Matrix 
- Optimization Approach: Mean-variance Framework & Sharpe Ratio maximization
- Financial Models: Capital Market Line (CML) & Security Market Line (SML), beta calculation for systematic Risk measurement

Findings:
- Significant difference in optimal allocation between constrained & unconstrained models
- MSCI Mexico dominates the optimal Portfolio when short selling is allowed (98% weight)
- Efficient frontier visualization, to demonstrate risk-return tradeoffs
